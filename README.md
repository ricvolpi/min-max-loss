# Code for the paper [Minimizing the Maximal Loss: How and Why](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.01690.pdf)

Unofficial implementation of the work by Shalev-Schwartz and Wexler (ICML 2016). 

## Getting started

The file Tree.py allows to build the full binary Tree used in the work and run the three functions necessary (initialize, sample, update). 

### Prerequisites

Python 2.7 (should work on Python 3, too), Numpy
